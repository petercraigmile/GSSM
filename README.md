Email questions about the code to pfc &lt;AT&gt; stat.osu.edu

The file GSSM.R contains R code to approximately simulate stationary Gaussian
processes using the Gaussian Spectral Synthesis Method (GSSM).

Look at the file test_GSSM.R for some simple examples of how to
approximately simulate time series using these R functions.
